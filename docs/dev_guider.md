### 1. **Introduction**
   - **Overview**: 
     - **MyNHANES** is a Python-based application designed to manage and analyze data from the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) datasets. This tool provides an intuitive interface for data ingestion, normalization, and transformation, allowing users to efficiently handle large datasets and customize data workflows.
   - **Features**:
     - Easy data ingestion and synchronization.
     - Customizable data normalization and transformation workflows.
     - Support for large datasets with optimized performance.
     - Integration with Django Admin for an intuitive user interface.

### 2. **Installation**
   - **Prerequisites**:
     - Python 3.12 or higher
     - pip (Python package installer)
     - Poetry (for dependency management)
   - **Steps**:
     1. **Clone the Repository**:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mynhanes.git
        cd mynhanes
        ```
     2. **Install Dependencies**:
        ```bash
        poetry install
        ```
     3. **Set Up the Environment**:
        - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
          ```
          DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=mynhanes.core.settings
          SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
          DEBUG=True
          ```
     4. **Initialize the Database**:
        ```bash
        python manage.py migrate
        python manage.py createsuperuser
        ```

### 3. **Configuration**
   - **Settings**:
     - All configurations are stored in the `mynhanes/core/settings.py` file.
     - Custom configurations can be added in a YAML file and referenced in the settings.
   - **Customization**:
     - Modify the `settings.py` to connect to a different database or to customize the behavior of the application.
     - Use the `settings.yaml` file for custom configurations like data paths, rule sequences, and other application-specific settings.

### 4. **Usage**
   - **Starting the Application**:
     - To start the Django development server:
       ```bash
       mynhanes runserver
       ```
     - Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
   - **Using the Admin Interface**:
     - After logging in with the superuser credentials, you can access various datasets, configure rules, and manage workflows through the Django Admin interface.
   - **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:
     - **Ingest Data**:
       ```bash
       mynhanes ingest
       ```
     - **Apply Transformations**:
       ```bash
       mynhanes transform
       ```
     - **Check System Status**:
       ```bash
       mynhanes check
       ```

### 5. **Advanced Usage**
   - **Creating Custom Rules**:
     - Explain how to create custom transformation rules using Python.
     - Provide examples and templates.
   - **Data Normalization**:
     - Details on how data normalization works within MyNHANES.
     - Instructions on how to configure and apply normalization rules.
   - **Extending MyNHANES**:
